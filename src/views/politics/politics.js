                            Daoism is officially required to aid in the countryâ€™s decisions regarding political parties, like communism.  The leaders of the country were also valued due to a set of qualities known as the Daoist models of kingship.  Dao texts were also studied and applied to various decisions involving the politics of the Chinese government.
